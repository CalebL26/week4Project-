# week4Project-
For the first file fridayPJ1.py, we made a python file with chatgpt 3.5 to generate a madlib with the user entering the input of the variables...such as adjectives, nouns, etc. 

After completing file fridayPj1.py, we then created a new file which I named fridayPj2.py, which was generated with chatgpt 3.5 as well. This file contained a generator for powerball numbers and return the powerball values at the end of the code in the terminal. 

For the final project fridayPj3.py, with the help of chat gpt 3.5 as well, I transfered a quiz bowl into the file. Which prompted the user to anwser short anwser questions and get a perecentage result at the end of the game to see how well they did.
